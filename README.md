Imagine you are a company that advertises on television. Your advertising expenses are very high, and you believe some costs need to be reduced. The first thing that comes to mind is: Are the ads really working Should I reduce them, and if so, what should I focus on reducing? Which time slot or hour would be better to cut back on? 
These types of questions have always been on the minds of companies. In this project, I present an analysis that provides answers to these questions.​​

​



# OBJECTIVE


To check whether the advertisements are truly meaningful. 
If a reduction in advertisements is considered, comparing the high-cost prime time slot with other slots and evaluating its importance.


Our hypotheses:
       *H0: There is no significant difference between the effects of public service announcements (PSA) and company advertisements (ad).
       *H1: There is a significant difference between the effects of public service announcements (PSA) and company advertisements (ad).

 
Tests were conducted with p-values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant.
